Drecksfirma.net
===============

These are the sources of the CGI-Binary behind drecksfirma.net, a website to vote for the worst company of the month.

I'm currently still working on it to create a first working version.

Some implementation-details:
* written in C++
* libcgicc for CGI handling
* HamsterDB for data storage
* simple templates, most of the HTML is stored outside the binary
